Modularity measurement

A high modularity score is generally desirable in a microservice architecture because it indicates that the service is modular and that the modules are well-defined and self-contained. This can lead to benefits such as better maintainability, scalability, and testability.

Conversely, a low modularity score may indicate that the service is monolithic or that the modules are poorly defined and interdependent. This can lead to difficulties in maintaining and scaling the service, as changes to one module may have unforeseen effects on other modules.

Unused Code measurement

If there is a lot of unused code in a microservice, it could indicate that the codebase is not as modular or reusable as it could be. This is because unused code can make it more difficult to understand and maintain the codebase, which can make it harder to reuse code across different parts of the microservice or in other projects.

In some cases, a significant amount of unused code can also impact the performance of the microservice. This is because the microservice may need to load and parse this code even though it is not being used, which can consume system resources and slow down the microservice's response times.
