A high modularity score is generally desirable in a microservice architecture because it indicates that the service is modular and that the modules are well-defined and self-contained. This can lead to benefits such as better maintainability, scalability, and testability.

Conversely, a low modularity score may indicate that the service is monolithic or that the modules are poorly defined and interdependent. This can lead to difficulties in maintaining and scaling the service, as changes to one module may have unforeseen effects on other modules.
